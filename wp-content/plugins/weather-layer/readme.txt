Display weather data on your blog thanks to Yahoo! Weather. Example of use : [weatherlayer country="France" city="Paris"]

== Description ==

Weather Layer is a plugin which allows you to display a layer with weather information for a choosen city.

For example, if you want to display weather for Paris into a post, you just need to insert the following shortcode :

[weatherlayer country="France" city="Paris"]

This will display a horizontal layer with weather information related to Paris, France. This format fits well for single posts. However, if you want to insert a weather layer into your sidebar, the WL widget is what you need. Drag and drop it in the widgets menu then fill the form.

Finally, if you want to display a vertical layer with a shortcode, use this :

[weatherlayer country="France" city="Paris" display="vertical"]

NB :
This plugin is using Yahoo! Weather API.
